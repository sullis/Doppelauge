Doppelauge
==========

Doppelauge is a set of six libraries for the Play Framework.
All code should be thoroughly tested.

* Json library: [J](JSON.md#j)
* Json pattern matcher: [JsonMatcher](JSON.md#jsonmatcher)
* Json value changer: [JsonChanger](JSON.md#jsonchanger)
* Json value diff: [JsonDiff](JSON.md#jsondiff)
* Swagger 2.0 Api doc generator: [API_DOC.md](API_DOC.md)
* Test by annotation test system: [TEST_BY_ANNOTATION.md](TEST_BY_ANNOTATION.md)



ScalaDoc
========

Play 2.5.x
=====================
Branch ``upgrading-deps has support`` for ``2.5.x``, but you need to inject the base classes used in ApiDoc using the same constructs as given in the specs, i.e. InjectHelper trait.

This branch is only tested with static routers. Dependency injected Controllers are not tested, and probably will not work . Look at the source code and the methods marked @deprecated. There are also functions using the injected Environment. You need to use these, and create a new Api that exposes them publically. PRs are welcome.

Play 2.3 vs. Play 2.4
=====================

* The master branch uses Play 2.4.
* Play 2.3 is supported in the play_2.3 branch, but is less updated.

  ```
